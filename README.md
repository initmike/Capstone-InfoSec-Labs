# Capstone-InfoSec-Labs
A collection of blue team and red team labs done in my capstone CSCI 400 course on Cybersecurity/Digital Forensics. 
Topics in these labs range from steganography, cryptography, rainbow tables and hash collisions, access control, IDS, firewalls, denial of service (attack and defense), buffer overflows, arbitrary code execution, path traversal exploits, sql injections, attacks on sandboxing, sandboxing escapes, xss and reflected xss, and lastly a wireless CTF in Kali Linux that also required reconnaissance. 
The PDF file available serves as a lab report for the topics completed within the respective lab. The PDF contains screenshots and descriptions for each lab. Supplementary files to complete the lab are provided.
